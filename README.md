# Analyzing a Time Series of the Thames River in Python
## Overview
This repository contains Python code and instructions for analyzing a time series dataset of the Thames River's tide levels. The dataset consists of 13 .txt files, each containing comma-separated data. The tasks included in this analysis are as follows:

### Task 1: Read one file to explore the data format and prepare the data for analysis.
Load the London Bridge dataset.
Clean and format the data for further analysis.
### Task 2: Analyze the London Bridge data to get a sense of the water level.
Create histograms and boxplots for high tide and low tide data.
Summarize statistics and count the number of days with high tide.
### Task 3: Assess monthly trends in water level for 1927, 1928, and 1929.
Group and resample the data to analyze monthly trends.
Plot high and low tide data for the specified years.
Task 4: Beginning a forecasting model for London Bridge: a taste of autocorrelation.
Plot high tide data for a sample.
Compute autocorrelation at various frequencies.
